## About Me
Hello there! Name's Evan :D

I'm a senior software developer/architect consultant, currently managing and developing data visualization tools for the CDC. I've been obsessed about what's transpiring with AI for the last 12-ish years, fully aware that it would soon completely change the world.

Inspired by Brian, the creator of Smart Connections, I started an AI consulting company called "Evan's Oasis." At Evan's Oasis, I audit business workflows for clients and recommend AI tools and practices that significantly enhance decision-making, productivity, and qualityâ€”while reducing the time and money needed to run a business.
