# Smart Memos v1.0

![SmartMemos](assets/SmartMemo.gif)

Welcome to the Smart Memos! This plugin integrates seamlessly with your Obsidian, offering an advanced, interactive way to transcribe and generate notes from your audio files. My goal is to enhance your ability to capture and understand information from audio sources, transforming the way you interact with and understand your information.

## Features
- **Audio Transcription**: Transcribe audio files into text using advanced AI models.
- **Note Generation**: Generate detailed notes in markdown language from the transcribed audio.
- **Customizable Prompts**: Customize the prompt that will be sent to the AI model before adding your transcribed audio so you can get any kind of analysis, note structure format, or enhancements you want!
- **Support for Multiple Audio Formats**: Supports mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, wav, webm audio formats.

## Installation
Getting started with the Smart Memos Plugin is easy. Follow these steps to install:

1. Download and install the Smart Memos Plugin from the Obsidian Community Plugins.
2. Configure the plugin settings with your OpenAI API Key and preferred AI model.

Note* This plugin currently uses online openAI models to recieve and transcribe your voice memos.  Looking to add Local AI Models in the nearer future. OpenAI does not retain audio data, only textual.

## Platforms

- Desktop
- Mobile (Android only) - Apple has their own audio format (m4a) that makes everyone's lives more difficult.  Will try to get around this without needing to use another library.

## Usage
Once installed, the Smart Memos Plugin provides an intuitive interface to transcribe your audio files and generate notes.

- **Transcribing Audio**: To transcribe an audio file after it's been imported or directly spoken into a note, move your cursor right underneath the audio file and use the command `Smart transcribe` from the command palette (Ctrl + p for Windows and Cmd + p for Mac). The plugin will transcribe the audio file and generate detailed notes. (Note:  Current limit is 25 MB (typically around 20-25 minutes max. Will update for longer recording soon)
- **Customizing the Prompt**: You can customize the prompt that will be sent to the AI model before adding your transcribed audio in the plugin settings.
- **Direct Audio input**: You record audio from your microphone directly in obsidian through the "Audio Recorder" core plugin that should be filled on by default.  You can find the mic icon ribbon in your left toolbar menu
- **Include Raw Transcript**: If you just want clean notes returned, you can remove the addition of the raw transcript at the end by toggling it off in the settings

## Vision
The Smart Memos plugin aims to revolutionize the way we capture and understand information from audio sources. By leveraging advanced AI models, the plugin can transcribe audio files and generate fully customizable notes, in-depth analysis, and idea expansion, freeing you from the tedious task of manual transcription and note-taking, while simultaneously expanding upon them to allow your two "brains" to work harmoneously.

The ultimate mission is to enhance productivity, ideas, and efficiency in note-taking, especially for users who frequently deal with audio sources of information or find it much easier to simply speak whatever is on their mind than write it all down. With this plugin, I envision a future where valuable information from audio sources doesn't get lost and is automatically integrated into your own, personalized way of note-taking.
